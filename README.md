## The stuff on the inside ~oooohhh~
* Game engine - Phaser.io
* Preprocessing - Node, Gulp, Babel
* Languages - ES6 JS <3

## External tooling
* Tiled, for building the tilemaps
* paint.net, GIMP, or any ***open source*** image editor of your choice, for building all the assets

## Usage

First, you need to install all the dependencies:

```sh
npm i && bower i
```


Now, let's run that gulp task. If you don't have gulp installed, follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) first.

Or if you're feeling fancy, here's a shortcut:

```sh
npm i -g gulp
```

Now to run that gulp task:

```sh
gulp
```

Great, now all you have to do is click on [this link](http://localhost:5000/package) and you're all set!

Enjoy :smiley:
